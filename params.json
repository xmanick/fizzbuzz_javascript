A classic example is to create a program that prints numbers 1 through 100, and if the number is divisible by 3 \"Fizz\" is also displayed, if the number is divisible by 5 \"Buzz\" is also displayed, and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 \"Fizzbuzz\" is also displayed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
